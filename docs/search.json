Recent consumer price index (CPI) data showed inflation was more stubborn than expected, making the Reserve Bank of Australiaâ€™s decision last month to abandon raising interest rates look too hasty. These circumstances suggest that a rate cut is unlikely in the short term, and instead requires a more sustained and prudent monetary policy response."
